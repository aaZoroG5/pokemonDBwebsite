# pokemonDBwebsite
This is my first website project that will include the use of Java, HTML, CSS, Springboot, mySQL, and Thymeleaf.
The purpose of this project is to create a space where Pokemon fans can find data about their favorite Pokemon and have the option to create a login to share their picks.
For the SQL database I referred to https://github.com/brianr852/Pokemon-Database
